Websites that I have created or modified

Referenced are three sites that I have personally made changes to. 

The Printbulliez site is all cosmetic changes for a small business. The platform is wix, and they needed a uniform color scheme, and I removed inactive links, and fixed links that were broken.

The Deepest Fear site is my personal business website and all changes and modifications made to the site are done by me on top of a squarespace template.

"It's Lit" is my senior computer science project about the lights on campus that was made completely from scratch, based on my university's database.
